            <h2> Our Reasoning </h2>
            <p>
                In many restaurants, the traditional method of taking orders, either by hand or from memory, often leads
                to inefficiencies and errors.
                Miscommunication between customers, servers, and kitchen staff can result in incorrect or delayed
                orders, frustrating both diners and employees.
                These issues are amplified during busy hours when the pace quickens, mistakes become more frequent, and
                service quality declines. Additionally,
                restaurant managers often lack access to real-time data such as current sales trends, popular dishes, or
                inventory levels, making it difficult
                to make informed business decisions on the fly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our solution is a tablet-based ordering system designed to sit at each table, putting control directly
                in the hands of the customer. Diners can easily
                browse the menu, customize their meals, and send orders straight to the kitchen, all without waiting for
                a server. The kitchen staff receives these
                orders instantly and in full detail, including any special requests, helping reduce confusion and
                preparation errors. Meanwhile, servers can spend
                more time enhancing the dining experience, and managers gain real-time access to valuable analytics like
                peak hours, top-selling items, and inventory
                data.
            </p>

            <p>
                By streamlining the ordering process and reducing reliance on manual input, our system significantly
                improves efficiency and accuracy. It makes
                ordering more intuitive and enjoyable for customers, while empowering restaurant staff with the tools
                they need to deliver better service. Ultimately,
                this leads to higher customer satisfaction and better workflow for the employees.

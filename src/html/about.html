            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                Our application is a tablet based ordering system designed specifically for restaurants, providing an
                intuitive and efficient way
                for customers to browse the menu, customize orders, and place them directly from their table. The system
                also includes features for
                restaurant staff to track sales, manage orders, and streamline the dining experience. The primary
                problem our application aims to solve
                is order inefficiency and miscommunication in traditional restaurant settings. Many restaurants still
                rely on manual order taking, where
                servers write down requests, relay them back to the kitchen, and then manage multiple customer
                interactions at once. This process can
                lead to delays, errors, and inconsistencies, especially during peak hours.

                By implementing a digital ordering system, we help restaurants enhance accuracy, reduce wait times, and
                improve overall customer satisfaction.
                Customers can easily customize their meals without the risk of miscommunication, and kitchen staff
                receive clear, instant notifications of each
                order. Additionally, restaurant managers gain access to live sales data, helping them analyze trends,
                manage inventory, and optimize business
                operations. This solution is particularly important in the modern restaurant industry, where efficiency
                and customer experience are key to success.
                Our system empowers businesses to provide a smoother dining experience while improving workflow and
                revenue.

            <h2>Users</h2>
            <p>
                The primary users of our application include restaurant customers, restaurant staff such as, servers and
                kitchen personnel, and restaurant managers
                or owners. Each group has distinct needs that our system addresses through an efficient, technology
                driven solution. Customers interact with the
                front end interface of our tablet based ordering system, requiring an intuitive and user friendly UI/UX
                that allows for smooth menu navigation,
                customization of orders, and live tracking. Our system minimizes human error, enhances order accuracy,
                and improves overall dining efficiency.
                Customers benefit from faster service and a personalized experience, leading to higher satisfaction.

                Orders placed through the tablet are instantly sent to the kitchen, eliminating the risk of
                misinterpretation from handwritten tickets. This allows
                servers to focus more on customer service rather than manual order management, improving overall
                workflow efficiency. Restaurant managers and owners
                benefit from the system's data driven approach to operations. By collecting and analyzing order trends,
                sales data, and inventory levels, they can
                make informed business decisions. Leveraging web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript our system
                enhances restaurant operations, improves
                customer experience, and maximizes efficiency through automation and data driven insights.

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>
                Our application provides a tablet based ordering system with several core functionalities designed to
                streamline restaurant operations and enhance
                the customer experience. The first key feature is the interactive menu interface, where customers can
                browse food items, view descriptions, and
                customize their orders. The system dynamically updates item availability based on real time inventory
                tracking, preventing customers from ordering
                out of stock items.

                Another essential functionality is order customization and special requests. Customers can modify
                ingredients, choose portion sizes, or add special
                instructions. The system ensures these customizations are properly formatted and included in the order
                details sent to the kitchen. For restaurant
                staff, the application provides a display system that organizes incoming orders in a queue, allowing
                chefs to efficiently prepare meals based on
                priority and preparation time. Meanwhile, servers have access to a dashboard where they can monitor
                order statuses and notify customers when their
                meals are ready.

                Managers benefit from live sales tracking and analytics, which allow them to identify popular menu
                items, monitor peak hours, and optimize inventory
                management. For example, if a customer orders a customized burger with no onions and extra cheese, the
                system records the request, updates the order
                queue for the kitchen, and ensures the cashier sees the correct total. This minimizes errors, reduces
                wait times, and improves overall restaurant
                efficiency, demonstrating the system's value in a real world scenario.

            <h2>Data</h2>
            <p>
                Our tablet based ordering system follows a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) model to efficiently
                manage restaurant operations. Customers,
                restaurant staff, and managers interact with different data entities, including orders, menu items,
                customers, and sales records. Customers create
                new orders by selecting menu items and customizing them based on their preferences, such as adding extra
                toppings or removing ingredients. Restaurant
                managers can also create new menu items, defining their name, price, ingredients, and availability.
                Whenever an order is placed, the system generates
                a sales record, storing details such as the purchased items, total cost, and timestamp.

                Reading data is essential for all users. Customers browse the menu to read item descriptions, prices,
                and availability. Kitchen staff access the kitchen
                display system to read incoming orders, ensuring accurate meal preparation. Meanwhile, managers review
                sales reports and analytics, helping them track
                popular items and optimize business operations. Updating data allows for flexibility and accuracy.
                Customers can modify their orders before finalizing
                them, while restaurant staff update order statuses, such as marking them as “In Progress” or
                “Completed.” Managers can adjust menu items, modifying
                prices, availability, or ingredients as needed.

                Lastly, deleting data ensures the system remains up to date. Customers can remove items from their cart
                before checkout, restaurant staff can delete
                canceled orders, and managers can remove discontinued menu items. After payment, the transaction is
                recorded, and managers can later delete outdated
                menu items to keep the menu current.
